##THIS IS NOT ORGANIZED WHATSOEVER NOR IS IT SUPPOSED TO BE USED TO REPRODUCE MY PROJECT

I just thought I should upload my project to GitHub and so I made this repo back in 2020 but everything ended up so disorganized and in different files that I never actually uploaded it.
Now come 2022, I had the feeling to upload everything except I no longer know which files were the ones in the final project.
I am simply guessing that the uploaded files were used therefore this will almost definitely not work if you just try to run stuff.
Additionally, the file paths in the notebooks rely on either my computer's file structure or my google drive's so that won't work either....

Anyway if you're reading this then hi. I have another project about chest X-ray classification that may or may not be finished too.
Although that one is also very disorganized......

There is also a thing I did for TigerGraph although that's just a commit to their pyTigerGraph product but can be found through my company github Dyllan-Hofflich-TG
